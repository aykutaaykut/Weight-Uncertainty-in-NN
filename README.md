# Weight Uncertainty in Neural Networks
Re-implementation of Weight Uncertainty in Neural Networks paper of Google DeepMind.

All the code with explanations is present in the jupyter notebook.
The implementation details with the gradient calculations and weight update equations are derived in the derivaitons.pdf file.
